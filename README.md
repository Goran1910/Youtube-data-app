After cloning the repository run queries located in fetch-data/create-database.sql
If you want to have up-to-date data run Main.py located in fetch-data folder.
In that case you will have to install mysql connector
  
  pip install mysql-connector-python

If you don't want to use python, you can run queries.sql located in fetch-data folder and populate database with older data.
